## The Basics

* Version Control
* Testing

---

## Build process

* Repeatable builds
  * Build your src 6 months from now
  * Build on different machines
  * Hosted NPM registry, vendored dependencies
* Automation
  * Gulp
  * Grunt
  * Some other task runner
* Deployable artifacts
  * tar.gz
  * Nexus

---

## Deployment process

* Automation
  * CI
  * Deploy tasks
  * Jenkins, Travis CI, Gulp/Grunt
* Rollback / Redeploy strategy
  * Deploy a build from the past
  * Redeploy the current build
* Zero downtime
  * Rolling deploy
  * Load balancing
  * Nginx, PM2, Cluster, *Heroku like PAAS

---

## Monitoring

* Healthchecks
  * Know when your service is broken
  * Automated error reporting
  * Pager duty
* Metrics
  * How many 5xx errors your service has
  * How many req/sec
  * Percentile request time
  * Custom metrics for business concerns
  * New Relic, Datadog, statsd + graphite

---

## Logging

* Centralized logging
  * Avoid logging into production machines
  * Logs are in one place
  * Log search
  * Heka, logstash, kibana, etc...
* Log management
  * Backups
  * Log rotation
  * Request AND error logs
  * Log levels
  * S3, logrotate, winston, bunyan

---

## Security

* Service isolation
  * Security groups (AWS)
* HTTPS
  * Anything related to logins
  * Personably identifiable information
  * End to end HTTPS
* Input validation
  * Don't trust anything from the internet
  * Assume malicious behavior
  * Sql injection
  * Large request attacks (ie file uploads)
* Rate limiting
  * DDOS
  * Brute force attacks
  * nginx, [node-rate-limiter](https://github.com/jhurliman/node-rate-limiter)
